- This NLP project focuses on analysing customer feedback to classify sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative. 
- Text data was preprocessed using tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming, then converted to numerical features using TF-IDF.
- Using machine learning models including Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest were trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the best performance.
